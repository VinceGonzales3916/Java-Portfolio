 This program is a simple canteen ordering system designed to let users order food and drinks from a menu, apply discounts based on their ID type, and generate a receipt showing their purchases, total cost, discount, payment, and change. It follows a step-by-step process from selecting items to final payment, making it easy to simulate how a real canteen cashier transaction works.
